## final-Ex3 - Robots communication simulation
##How to run? 
- open a python project and run it from simulation file
##The simulation can do:
-Random Robot moves,Robot sends and receives a message according to strengths,Save the file messages historic,and more!

- The simulation ends as soon as the robot know what his starting position to an accuracy Epsilon
-use: Root mean square algorithm ,Random Arrays algorithm and more
